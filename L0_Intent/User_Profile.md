# User Profile — Developer Context

> Personal expertise, preferences, and constraints to help agents adapt recommendations.
> This document is read by all agents to calibrate their outputs to the developer's context.

---

## Technical Expertise

**Unreal Engine:**
- Level: Avancé + / expert
- Focus areas: C++ gameplay, replication, animation systems, audio systems
- Experience: 3+ years total UE (4.x → 5.x)

**Blueprints:**
- Level: Avancé
- Nombreux outils UE rencontrés : Niagara, Procedural systems, data-driven design, rapid prototyping, State Tree, component based design, replication..
- Preference: Approche novatrice. Hybride CPP - Blueprint.

**Tools:**
- Primary IDE: VS Code (Antigravity), Rider
- Version Control: Git + LFS
- DCC: Blender, Pro Tools (audio)
- Documentation: Obsidian
- Other: Antigravity agents, command line proficiency, ACC,

## Methodological Preferences

**Core Principles:**
- **Architecture First** (strict adherence, no code without design)
- **Code quality > speed** (clean code, maintainability prioritized)
- **Documentation as code** (inline comments, design docs, specs)
- **Iterative refinement** preferred over big-bang delivery
- **Data-driven design** (avoid hard-coding, use data assets)

**Decision-Making:**
- Prefers **2-3 concrete options** with explicit trade-offs
- Values **research-backed recommendations** (L5 citations)
- Dislikes ambiguity or "trust me" proposals
- Willing to iterate, **reluctant to redo from scratch**

**Workflow:**
- Structured workflows > ad-hoc execution
- Checklists and validation checkpoints appreciated
- Visual aids helpful (diagrams, Canvas maps)

---

## Personal Constraints

**Context:**
- Solo developer (no team, all decisions personal)
- Every day activity
- Limited daily focus time (manage energy carefully) 
- Multitasking across roles: design, code, tools, business

**Cognitive Patterns:**
- **Perfectionism tendency:** Risk of over-engineering
- **TDAH indicators:** Prefer structured workflows, clear checkboxes, external memory
- **Deep focus sessions:** Best work in 2-4h uninterrupted blocks
- **Context switching cost:** High (avoid frequent task changes)

**Productivity:**
- Peak hours: Morning/afternoon (energy-dependent)
- Breaks required: Every 90-120 minutes
- Documentation helps offload cognitive load

---

## Decision Patterns

**What Works:**
- ✅ Clear problem statement + 2-3 solutions with trade-offs
- ✅ Concrete examples, not just theory
- ✅ Progressive implementation (Phase 1, 2, 3...)
- ✅ Explicit dependencies and blockers

**What Doesn't Work:**
- ❌ "Just do X" without explanation
- ❌ Vague high-level only (needs concrete next steps)
- ❌ Over-abstraction without grounding examples
- ❌ Silent assumptions about knowledge/context

**Iteration Style:**
- Prefer **refinement** over **replacement**
- Accept imperfect V1 if V2 refinement path clear
- Comfortable with "good enough for now, improve later" if debt tracked

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid (Personal)

**Triggers Resistance:**
- "Quick fix" suggestions (violates Architecture First)
- Bypass L2 (Design) for "simple task"
- Ambiguous requirements ("make it better")
- Silent changes without explanation

**Known Traps:**
- Over-optimization too early (premature abstraction)
- Perfectionism paralysis (never "good enough")
- Scope creep without validation
- Burnout from sustained high-intensity periods

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Explicit validation checkpoints
- Effort levels (Low/Medium/High) instead of time estimates
- "Good enough" criteria defined upfront
- Regular breaks and energy management

---

## Communication Preferences

**Language:**
- French to user (all reports, recommendations)
- Technical terms in English (UE5 API, design patterns)

**Tone:**
- Direct, concise, structured
- Explain "why" not just "what"
- Reference research when available (L5 citations)

**Format:**
- Markdown with clear sections
- Bullet points > long paragraphs
- Visual aids when applicable (Mermaid, Canvas)

---

## Agent Adaptation Guidelines

**When making recommendations:**
1. Cite L5 research if strategic
2. Present 2-3 options with trade-offs
3. Use effort levels (Low/Medium/High), not hours
4. Acknowledge perfectionism risk if relevant
5. Provide concrete next steps

**When detecting issues:**
- STOP and explain clearly (not "something's wrong")
- Reference specific rule/layer violated
- Suggest correction path

**When uncertain:**
- ASK rather than assume
- Present gap explicitly
- Wait for human clarification
